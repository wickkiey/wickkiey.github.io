Jan 2019 – July 2023 
Happiestminds Technologies 
Loan Default and Conversion Analysis (Team Lead)
Client: US Based Banking consultancy 
•	Developed and deployed a loan default prediction model for short-term loans. Increased the revenue by reducing the Loan default rate from 34% to 18%.
•	Designed and deployed a conversion model, to predict whether the user will accept the Loan. Reduced the cost by not spending on the conversion process. 
•	 Implemented Data and Model drift and integrated CML (Continuous machine learning) pipelines.
•	CatBoost, H2O, AWS Lambda, Feature tools, MLFlow, DVC

Product Image Validation & Demand Forecasting 
Client: US Based on major OEM Supplier
•	Developed and deployed an image segmentation modeling pipeline (augmentation, training, finetuning, auto deployment) to detect manufacturing products. Reduced the manual efforts and increased the throughput from days to hours of verifying whether right product is being uploaded in the portal.
•	U-Net, Mobilenet V2, Tensorflow, Tesseract, Airflow, Docker
•	Designed and deployed a segmentation mode to group similar items sold with demand history data. 
•	Implemented demand forecasting model on big-data. Improved the revenue and reduced the store life time of products. 
•	PySpark, SparkML, Databricks, Azure Data Factory, ADLS
•	Built and published Power-BI Dashboard and included KPIs and business metrics.
Built anomaly detection and failure detection for IOT Event hub streaming data.
Intelligent Image Search
Client: US based Energy & Production Organization
•	Implemented and deployed Image based search engine. Developed a pipeline to curate the content with Object Detection and OCR and built a search engine on top extracted features (Image Embeddings + Objects + text).
- Resnet, EasyOCR, OpenCV, Bigquery, Computer Vision

Integrity Application (Face Recognition)
Client: Happiestminds
•	Implemented and deployed a face recognition application to identify integrity though-out the interview process. Identified few incidents where different people attending different rounds for same interview.
•	Deep Face, OpenCV, FastAPI, Angular, Computer Vision
Feb 2016 – Dec 2018 
Aagnaa Software Labs (Product Based, Vision)
•	Virtual Try-On
Implemented an AR (augmented reality) product that drapes digital cloth contents over the user’s body in real-time video stream.  Deployed in PN-RAO & Raymonds Bangalore for suits and ties.
